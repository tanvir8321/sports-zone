# Sports Zone Apllication

Here I have used API to get the team information. I used bootstrap for the design. When you enter the live link, you will see the home page first. Where there is little team information on separate cards. You can see the details of the team by clicking on the More option. The header logo is dynamic. In other words, the logo of the team you want to see will show. The image of the team will change according to the condition. If it is a girl, then the girl will show the picture of the team. And if it is a boy, the boy will show the picture of the team.
